 * layout alone; the last pages stay on screen until the next are ready, so an
 * edit never blanks the view. A layout that outlives its diagram is dropped,
 * and one whose diagram is outlived before it starts is never begun: it
 * starts a task later, behind the input already waiting, so a burst of edits
 * — Arrow Up held in the path's width — lays out its last diagram, not each.
 *
 * The flow pages a layout packed are adopted into the store's diagram while
 * it is still the one laid out ({@link adoptPacked}), so the next layout
 * holds them; the adopted diagram takes these same pages, not a layout of its
 * own. Not a layout that went without a CJK face its text needs
 * (`PreparedDiagramPages.unavailableFonts`, offline on the desktop): its
 * captions were measured with another face's advances, and boxes cut for
 * those would be held, and saved, once the face is had.
